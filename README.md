# Hi! I'm J.K. üëãüèº

I'm a full-stack web developer, designer, and educator based out of Richmond, Virginia. I'm part of the instructional staff for a coding bootcamp helping students at the University of Central Florida and University of Richmond learn the MERN stack. I also design and develop websites for small businesses and musical artists. I love developing beautiful websites and user interfaces with React, learning new CSS tricks, creating prototypes in Figma, and working with coding bootcamp students.
